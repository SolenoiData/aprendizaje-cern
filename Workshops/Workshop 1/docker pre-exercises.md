## Docker pre-exercises
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

In short, Docker allows a user to work in a computing environment that has been frozen with respect to interdependent libraries and code and related tools. This means that you can use the same software that analysts were using 10 years ago (for example) without downloading all the relevant 10-year-old libraries. :)
